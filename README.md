## VolunteerGo
Ever had a hankerin' to give back to society, but no feasible way to tell when you'd have the time? Heck, it's hard enough to squeeze in lunch, much less some volunteer time. And even if you found the time, you can't even go do the thing because you didn't tell the non-profit in time! What's a good samaritan to do?

#### Use this app, that's what!
VolunteerGo is here to lend a helping hand.

This app is still a work-in-progress, but here is a list of features that will be implemented:

Organizations can:
- Sign up to be part of the network of non-profit organizations
- Start receiving pings (volunteers send this to alert you of their availability) right away
- Accept or decline pings based on your organizational needs
- Turn pings on or off

Volunteers can:
- Sign up to be part of the network of volunteers
- Send pings to organizations
- See what organizations are near their current location
